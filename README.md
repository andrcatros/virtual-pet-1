# Virtual Pet - Coming Soon

At bootcamp, we are learning about **OOP** in JavaScript. To help us grasp these concepts our task is to build a **virtual pet**. I'm feeling nostalgic for my old tamagotchi now.

We are also learning **TDD**. This project will come with a full test suite written in **Jest**.

### How will you be able to interact with this virtual pet?

- [x]  You can give them a name
- [x]  They can get older
- [x]  As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit
- [x]  You can walk your pet to increase its fitness. 🏃‍♂️
- [x]  You can feed your pet to decrease its hunger. 🍕
- [x]  You can talk to your pet to see if it needs feeding or walking
- [x]  If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 💀
- [x]  If your pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE 😢
